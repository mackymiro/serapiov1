						Dear Serapio,<br>
						About 25 years ago, I put myself in your shoe as I present my research output in my industrial psychology class about the life of the seafarers onboard I titled it "Life Over Troubled Waters". It was a qualitative research where together with my research team we boarded a ship bound for Mindanao wherein back and forth we conducted interviews among the crew with the approval of their human resource department. 
						<br><br>
						Two years back then, I was so fascinated of taking a maritime course, unfortunately out of poverty I was intimidated with the white uniforms that appears to me very expensive which in my circumstance would not permit me to pursue my dream. 
						In 1998, I was coincidentally hired as a guidance counselor in a maritime school where the process of "marinating" myself started, a term used by all of us who are not seafarers but by chance has to understand the life of every seafarer being an employee of a maritime school and dealing with maritime partners and clientele. From my initial entry as guidance counselor, I started immersing myself to the journey of every Serapio. 
						<br><br>
						I build up my career in the maritime world taking an active participation in molding every Serapio as social sciences instructor primarily handling psychology classes. Then I was taking a more challenging career as quality manager ensuring the university's compliance to international standard. 
						Discerning that a more meaningful career awaits me in Serapio's world, I relinquish my quality management representative position. I engage myself to different maritime institution an entrepreneur and as a consultant. 
						<br>
						<br>
						Knowing and understanding the circumstances of every Serapio, with 25 years of marinating myself, I felt the calling to reach out every Serapio who needs a personalized virtual assistant and extend guidance and professional help towards work life balance.
